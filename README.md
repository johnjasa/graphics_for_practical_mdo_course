# Graphics for [Practical MDO Course](https://openmdao.github.io/PracticalMDO/intro.html)

This repo contains all the files used to produce graphics and animations for the Practical MDO Course lectures.
The animations are done using [Manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/) and I created some of the .svg files using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
The files here follow the same structure as the course in that there are three main topics (model construction, model differentiation, and optimization) and then subtopics within those.

To create the set of animations for a given lecture, run the Python script using Manim, i.e.

```
manim -p -qh example.py
```
